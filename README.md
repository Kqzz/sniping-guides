# sniping guides

Guides on minecraft name sniping to make it more approachable for new users

## Plans

I kinda abandoned this project temporarily, I'll hopefully get to working on it soon.

- Integration with discord bot
- Hosted as docs page through github pages


## Contributing

If you see any grammatical mistakes or would like to add something, open the file that needs to be changed and click the pencil icon, this will prompt you to edit it. commit these changes and create a pull request. Chances are, if I agree with the content in the commit I will merge the changes.
