# Offset / Delay

delay and offset are two words for the same thing. In this guide I will refer to it as offset. *offset is how early your sniper sends snipe requests, measured in milliseconds*. For example, if you have an offset of 30, your sniper will send snipe requests 30 milliseconds before droptime.

## "Finding" an offset

The reality is, no offset will be "perfect."
