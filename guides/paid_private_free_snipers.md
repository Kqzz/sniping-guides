# Paid vs Private vs Free Snipers

> These are just *my* opinions on paid vs free snipers, and as such, should be taken with a grain of salt.

Before I begin, I should say that I generally do not like paid snipers, and believe that in 99% of scenarios they are not a good purchase. The reality is, every Minecraft name sniping program is *basically* the same. They all just send requests to mojang's servers at the right time. A paid sniper will do the same thing as free one, and offer almost nothing over a free one.

## Why you would buy a paid sniper

The *only* reason I can think of for purchasing a paid sniper, would be buying one specifically becaues it comes with a web UI, making it easier to snipe with. Other than that, there's no reason to not use a free one.
